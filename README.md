This project analyzes a dataset of bike buyers to identify patterns and factors influencing purchasing decisions. The dataset consists of 1,026 records with demographic and lifestyle attributes such as income, occupation, education, and home ownership status. The key objective is to determine the characteristics of individuals who are more likely to purchase a bike.

Analysis and Insights

1. Demographic Analysis

Examining the relationship between age, income, and bike purchases.

2. Categorical Analysis

Understanding how occupation, education, and homeownership impact purchasing decisions.

3. Visualization

Using pivot tables and dashboards to highlight trends and correlations.

Key Findings

Income & Bike Purchase: Individuals with higher income levels were more likely to purchase bikes.

Occupation Influence: Professionals and skilled workers showed a higher tendency to own bikes.

Commute Distance Impact: Shorter commutes (0-1 miles) correlated with lower bike purchases, while mid-range distances (2-5 miles) showed a higher likelihood.

Marital Status & Family Size: Single individuals with no children were more likely to buy bikes.

Conclusion & Recommendations

Based on the findings, marketing strategies can be tailored towards professionals with moderate commute distances and higher disposable income. Future research can explore additional behavioral factors and external economic influences to refine predictions.

This study provides valuable insights for businesses targeting potential bike buyers and urban planners promoting sustainable commuting.
